# Rime table
# coding: utf-8
#@/db_name	custom_phrase.txt
#@/db_type	tabledb
#
# 自定义短语
# 可为方案增加一些要置顶的词汇及短语，例如邮箱、手机号、常用短语等等。编码可以随便起，不限于拼音。
#
# 适用于全拼。双拼默认为 custom_phrase_double.txt 需要手动创建，并更改上面的 db_name 为 custom_phrase_double.txt
#
# 以下固定的词汇及顺序纯属个人偏好，仅作示例，
# 可以增加自己的 .txt 文件，并在方案的 custom_phrase/user_dict 指定为自己的文件。
#
# 以 Tab 分割：词汇<Tab>编码<Tab>权重
#
# 这个文件内的字词会占据最高权重（即排在候选项的最前面，因为指定了高权重 custom_phrase/initial_quality: 99）。
# 所以只建议固定非完整拼音的编码，如果需求是置顶指定拼音的候选项，请参考方案中的 pin_cand_filter。
#
# 英文单词来源：https://github.com/sapbmw/The-Oxford-3000/tree/master
# 去掉了4个以下字母的单词，输入时都使用u开头，避免比如cong输入从时被英文单词占据前面的位置
